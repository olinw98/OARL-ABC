# OARL-ABC
This project was part of my PhD thesis at Georgia Tech on the calibration and validation of digital twins via a novel surrogate model-assisted Online Adaptive Reinforcement Learning and Approximate Bayesian Computation (OARL-ABC) method I developed. The files in ModelTrainerProject constitute my original proof of concept, allowing a user to upload a set of real data and define a set of models with uncertain parameters needing calibration. The models and their corresponding parameters could then be sampled and calibrated, via reinforcement learning for model selection and approximate Bayesian computation for parameter calibration. BDT.py then expands on this proof of concept, and was designed to be used in my thesis experiments to calibrate a model of a Machinery Fault Simulator using either ROSS rotordynamic models or Bayesian network model surrogates. Running this code requires real datasets that were not included in this repository but are available for demonstration upon request.
